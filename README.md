# 8-queens
Software for solving the eight queens puzzle (using LDFS, BFS, IDS search algorithms)

The Eight Queens Puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
The developed software solves the problem using search algorithms LDFS, BFS, IDS and shows a step-by-step solution.
The tkinter package
Software to solve the problem was developed using the Python programming language in compliance with OOP principles. The tkinter library is used for the template graphical representation.
