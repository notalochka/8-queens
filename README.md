# 8-queens
Software for solving the eight queens puzzle (using LDFS, BFS, IDS search algorithms)

The Eight Queens Puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
The developed software solves the problem using search algorithms LDFS, BFS, IDS and shows a step-by-step solution.

Software to solve the problem was developed using the Python programming language in compliance with OOP principles. The tkinter package is used for the template graphical representation.

# USER'S GUIDE
In order to use program, download all files in the "try this" folder.
After running the executable file with the *.exe extension, the main window of the programme opens

Next step, the user places 8 queens so that no two queens share the same row, column.
To solve the problem, the user selects an algorithm and clicks the "Solve" (Розв’язати) button
